# Implementation-of-Linear-Regression-Using-Gradient-Descent

## AIM:
To write a program to predict the profit of a city using the linear regression model with gradient descent.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1.Import the required library and read the dataframe.

2.Write a function computeCost to generate the cost function.

3.Perform iterations og gradient steps with learning rate.

4.Plot the Cost function using Gradient Descent and generate the required graph.
